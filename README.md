This repository provides a detailed documentation for implementing CogView project.

Code Files: are available in folder "CogView-main" or at URL "https://github.com/knowlearnable/TTUNeuralNetworkCourse/tree/main/CogView-main".

Documentation is available in file "CogView_Implementation.docx" or at URL "https://github.com/knowlearnable/TTUNeuralNetworkCourse/CogView_Implementation.docx".

The document covers below sections involved in the project report work.
1) Implementation
2) Demonstration
3) Enhancements
4) Issues

Input:
Text input to the neural network model is placed in a file called "input.txt" which is visible at code location "https://github.com/knowlearnable/TTUNeuralNetworkCourse/tree/main/CogView-main/input.txt"

Output:
Based on model configurations there are different outputs.
1) Blur output: Which is obtained as normal output.
2) Clear output: which is obtained with enhanced parameters.
3) Time based output: This is the same output image but obtained with less time due to enhanced configurations.

Enhanced Files:
Files which are modified to enhance the characteristics of neural network model are placed in separate folder called "Enhanced files" or at URL "https://github.com/knowlearnable/TTUNeuralNetworkCourse/tree/main/CogView-main/Enhanced_files".

Pre-Requisites required for the project:
1) Computer with a minimum requirement of 8 GB RAM + 50 GB Hard-disk
2) Virtualization Software (VMWare Workstation or Virtual Box)
3) Any linux distribution image file to be mounted on virtualization software (Kali, Ubuntu, RHEL etc)
4) Python 3.6+ installed on Virtual Machine

Source and References:
Taking below Research paper as reference, this project implementation has been performed on a virtual machine (Kali Linux) on a personal computer with Virtual Box.
